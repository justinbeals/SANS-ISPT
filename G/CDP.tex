\chapter{Clean Desk Policy}
\CommonIntroduction
\section{Overview}
A clean desk policy can be an import tool to ensure that all sensitive/confidential materials are removed from an end user workspace and locked away when the items are not in use or an employee leaves his/her workstation.  
It is one of the top strategies to utilize when trying to reduce the risk of security breaches in the workplace.  
Such a policy can also increase employeeâ€™s awareness about protecting sensitive information.
\section{Purpose}
The purpose for this policy is to establish the minimum requirements for maintaining a \q{clean desk} where sensitive/critical information about \del{our }employees, \del{our }intellectual property, \del{our }customers\oxford{} and \del{our }vendors is secure in locked areas and out of site.  
A clean desk policy is not only ISO 27001/17799 compliant, but it is also part of standard basic privacy controls.
\section{Scope}
This policy applies to all \CompanyName{} employees and affiliates.
